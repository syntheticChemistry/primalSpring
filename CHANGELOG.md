All notable changes to primalSpring are documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased] — Phase 59: Foundation Absorption + Security Hardening + projectNUCLEUS Phase 2a (2026-05-06)

### Milestone
- **Foundation layer absorption**: primalSpring as "validation pressure" for
  `sporeGarden/foundation`. Graph schema extended (`fallback`, `purpose`),
  structural checks evolved (fallback consistency, provenance trio requirement
  for validation graphs), foundation validation graph in catalog.
- **exp107_foundation_validation**: 8-phase Rust experiment validating the full
  foundation sediment pipeline through live IPC (structural → discovery → health →
  provenance → storage → compute → ledger → attribution).
- **Discovery Escalation Hierarchy**: 5-tier mechanism (Songbird → biomeOS Neural
  API → UDS → socket registry → TCP probing) implemented in `CompositionContext`.
- **projectNUCLEUS Phase 59 handback resolved**: 5 gaps (checksums, operation nodes,
  bonding policy, dag/provenance taxonomy, sweetGrass port).
- **fieldMouse reclassified** as deployment class (biomeOS chimera for edge/IoT).

### Added
- `GraphNode.fallback: Option<String>` for graceful degradation (`"skip"`).
- `GraphMetadata.purpose: Option<String>` for composition intent (`"validation"`, `"foundation"`).
- `graphs/compositions/foundation_validation.toml` — 12-node NUCLEUS for sediment pipeline.
- `experiments/exp107_foundation_validation/` — foundation validation via IPC.
- `wateringHole/FOUNDATION_ABSORPTION_MAY06_2026.md` — downstream handoff.
- Structural checks: `fallback="skip"` requires `required=false`; validation-purpose
  graphs require provenance trio capabilities (`dag`, `ledger`, `attribution`).

### Changed
- Capability taxonomy: `"provenance"` removed from `ALL_CAPS` and TCP fallback table;
  preserved as routing alias to `"dag"`. 8 graph TOMLs standardized to `by_capability = "dag"`.
- `CompositionContext::discover()` as canonical entry point with escalation hierarchy.
- Module splits: `deploy/validation.rs` (structural checks), `coordination/probes.rs`.
- `PrimalDeployProfile.bind_flag` — per-primal bind address CLI flag knowledge (PG-55).
- `GraphMetadata.bind_policy` — composition-level bind intent (`"localhost"`, `"lan"`, `"any"`).
- 661 tests (613 passed + 48 ignored), 85 experiments (19 tracks), 74 deploy graphs.

### Security (projectNUCLEUS Phase 2a handback — ALL RESOLVED)
- **PG-55 RESOLVED**: All 13 primals now default to `127.0.0.1`. Songbird, ToadStool,
  skunkBat, biomeOS, petalTongue shipped `--bind`; sweetGrass defaults bare `--port`
  to localhost. biomeOS nucleus forwards `--bind`.
- **PG-56 RESOLVED**: NestGate BTSP method-level auth gating. 10-method exempt whitelist.
- **PG-57 RESOLVED**: skunkBat multi-dimensional baseline (rate + volume + port diversity).
- **PG-58 RESOLVED**: Songbird `--bind` for HTTP, `--listen` for IPC (documented).
- **PG-59 RESOLVED**: sweetGrass `--http-address` and `--port` formats documented.
- **Positive**: All primals survived input fuzzing (7 malformed JSON-RPC each).
  No crashes, no hidden admin methods. Rust serde provides strong default resilience.
- Bind flag table in `docs/NUCLEUS_IPC_METHOD_MAP.md` — 13/13 OK.
- `tools/regenerate_checksums.sh` — automated BLAKE3 checksum generation.

## [0.9.24] — Phase 58: skunkBat NUCLEUS + Guidestone Hardening + plasmidBin CI Hub (2026-05-03)

### Milestone
- **skunkBat wired as 13th NUCLEUS primal** (meta-tier, defense/recon): composition
  layer, desktop cell graph, deployment scripts, and fetch all updated 12 → 13.
  Tier 1 binaries available via plasmidBin (GAP-28 resolved).
- **Guidestone hardening**: BTSP alias routing (`resolve_btsp_socket`) prefers
  family-scoped sockets over capability aliases. Flex key resolution
  (`call_f64_flex`, `call_array_flex`) handles barraCuda response format
  variations. Desktop cell health node added. Squirrel reconnect-on-failed-probe.
- **plasmidBin CI hub architecture documented**: sole paid Actions repo,
  per-primal concurrency, signing roadmap, future distribution channels.

### Added
- `primal_names::SKUNKBAT` constant and TCP fallback port 9750.
- `resolve_btsp_socket` helper — prefer family-scoped sockets for BTSP handshakes.
- `call_f64_flex` / `call_array_flex` — multi-key JSON-RPC response parsing.
- `validate_parity_flex` / `validate_parity_vec_flex` — flexible validation helpers.
- `"defense"` capability in `ALL_CAPS`; `"recon"`, `"threat"`, `"lineage"` in
  `BTSP_EXTRA_CAPS`.
- skunkBat node in `nucleus_desktop_cell.toml` (order 11, meta-tier).
- `plasmidBin/CONTEXT.md` CI hub architecture section: pipeline, concurrency,
  cost model, distribution channels, signing roadmap, fetch contract.

### Changed
- NUCLEUS primal count: 12 → 13 across 25+ files (Rust code, graphs, tools, specs,
  whitePaper/baseCamp, wateringHole docs).
- `desktop_nucleus.sh`: skunkBat in `SPAWNED_PRIMALS`, capability symlinks, health
  check denominator, seed fingerprint threshold.
- `fetch_primals.sh`: skunkBat moved from `DEFENSE_PRIMALS` to `NUCLEUS_PRIMALS`.
- `FullNucleus` in `coordination/mod.rs`: 13 primals, 13+ capabilities.
- `plasmidBin/README.md`: skunkBat coverage lib-only → FULL, removed from gaps.
- Squirrel BTSP probe: re-establish cleartext client on upgrade failure.

### Fixed
- BTSP alias routing: capability sockets (e.g. `shader.sock`) now resolved to
  family-scoped primal sockets where BTSP listeners are active.
- barraCuda parity checks: flex keys handle `result`, `mean`, `data`, `matrix`,
  `output`, `value` response shapes.
- Desktop cell graph: `validate_cell` node with health check targets added.

## Phase 57: BTSP Phase 3 Convergence + NUCLEUS Validation (2026-05-02)

### Milestone
- **BTSP Phase 3 COMPLETE — 13/13 FULL AEAD**: All 13 NUCLEUS primals ship
  `btsp.negotiate` + ChaCha20-Poly1305 encrypted framing. Final three primals
  converged May 2: loamSpine (`3dcd6b7`), coralReef (`f2d6bcf`), NestGate
  (`ef3ac568f`). Ecosystem-wide ionic/weak bond compositions unblocked.

### Added
- `wateringHole/CRYPTO_CONSUMPTION_HIERARCHY.md` — new standard defining crypto
  posture per primal role: key acquisition patterns (self-derive vs Tower-provided),
  bonding escalation hierarchy, composition contexts, recommended AEAD posture.
- Development system topology in `CONTEXT.md` — eastGate (primary dev, BTSP
  convergence, plasmidBin CI/CD) and ironGate (sister dev, clean deploys,
  ludoSpring + groundSpring).
- Live NUCLEUS validation pass on eastGate with plasmidBin v2026.05.03 binaries.

### Changed
- `PRIMAL_GAPS.md` Phase 3 scoreboard: 13/13 COMPLETE with per-primal commit refs.
- `UPSTREAM_CROSSTALK_AND_DOWNSTREAM_ABSORPTION.md` Phase 3 table: 13/13 FULL AEAD.
- `CRYPTO_WIRE_CONTRACT.md` header: Phase 2 → Phase 3.
- `PLASMINBIN_DEPOT_PATTERN.md`: 12 → 13 NUCLEUS primals.
- `wateringHole/README.md`: 3 → 4 documents, fixed composition lib path, cleared
  Phase 3 from remaining debt.
- `CHECKSUMS`: regenerated (2 files drifted since April).

### Discovered
- **Phase 3 client-server interop gap**: primalSpring client negotiates
  `chacha20-poly1305`, derives SessionKeys, sends encrypted frames — servers
  respond in plaintext (`0x7B226A73` = `{"js` read as 2GB frame). Servers
  advertise AEAD but don't switch transport. Next interop step for all teams.
- **NestGate JWT gate**: `NESTGATE_JWT_SECRET` required even in NUCLEUS
  socket-only mode. Upstream gap: skip JWT when BTSP is the auth layer.
- **guidestone 157/170** (20 skipped, 13 failures): bonding model ALL PASS,
  cellular 69/70, Phase 3 interop and discovery routing account for failures.

## [0.9.24] — Phase 56: Local Debt + Upstream Pull Wave + Reharvest (2026-04-29)

### Fixed (Reharvest Pass)
- **GAP-22 RESOLVED**: `dag.session.create` returns bare UUID string — experiments
  were looking for `{"session_id":"..."}` wrapper. Fixed response parsing in exp105/106.
- **GAP-23 RESOLVED**: `crypto.blake3_hash` expects base64-encoded `data` param.
  Experiments were sending raw text. Added base64 crate + encoding to exp105/106.
- **GAP-24 NEW+RESOLVED**: Barracuda `noise.perlin2d` API changed: `width`/`height` → `x`/`y`,
  response `{"data":[...]}` → `{"result":0.0}`. Fixed in exp105/106. Previous PASS was
  false positive (used `unwrap_or(0.0)` on missing field).
- **GAP-25 NEW+RESOLVED**: loamSpine `spine.create` now requires `owner` field. Added to exp105.
- **GAP-26 NEW+RESOLVED**: sweetGrass `contribution.record` with `content_hash` matching
  braid `data_hash` returns "Braid already exists". Use unique contribution hash per call.
- **GAP-27 NEW (blocking)**: biomeOS binary in plasmidBin is pre-v3.31. `graph.list/status/save`
  return 0/error. `capability.discover("storage")` misroutes to ToadStool. Rebuild needed.
- NestGate storage fallback: experiments now use `discover_primal("nestgate")` when
  biomeOS Tier 1 discovery misroutes `storage` to ToadStool
- exp105: false positive in `biome_noise` fixed — now checks `r.result.is_some()` before
  reporting PASS; proper error reporting on all RPC failures

### Fixed (Prior — symlinks + family_id)
- `desktop_nucleus.sh`: 13 capability-aliased symlinks via `create_capability_symlinks()`
  bridging GAP-17/18/19 (visualization, orchestration, game_science → primal sockets)
- NestGate `storage.store/get` calls include `family_id` (GAP-21 local mitigation)
- exp106 biomeOS discovery: multi-name fallback (biomeos → neural-api → orchestration)

### Resolved Upstream (pulled April 29)
- **biomeOS v3.31**: GAP-13/14/15/16 all RESOLVED
- **petalTongue**: GAP-01 + motor P0 + GAP-17 RESOLVED
- **NestGate S49**: GAP-21 RESOLVED
- **BearDog W76**: IONIC-RUNTIME confirmed, blake3 error messages improved
- **barraCuda Sprint 48**: BTSP-BARRACUDA-WIRE RESOLVED
- **ToadStool S207**: Self-registration via `ipc.register`
- **Squirrel**: GAP-03 RESOLVED LOCAL
- **rhizoCrypt S55**: UDS audit confirms no path-dependent behavior

### Experiment Scores (Post-Reharvest)
- exp101 fieldMouse AI Triage: **ALL PASS** (2/2, 1 skip)
- exp105 The Rhizome: **ALL PASS** (17/17, 4 skips)
- exp106 Micro-Desktop Shell: **11/14** (3 fails = GAP-27 stale biomeOS binary, 2 skips)

### Updated
- Gap report: 20/27 gaps RESOLVED (13 upstream + 7 local), 1 blocking (GAP-27), 6 minor
- `PRIMAL_GAPS.md` header refreshed with reharvest results
- Priority order: 0 HIGH, 1 MEDIUM (GAP-27), 6 LOW

## [0.9.23] — Phase 56: Desktop Substrate + The Rhizome (2026-04-28)

### Added
- **8 new experiments** (exp099–exp106): Track 18 — Desktop Substrate
  - exp099: Agentic loop substrate (petalTongue ↔ biomeOS ↔ Squirrel feedback)
  - exp100: MCP ecosystem tools (Squirrel `tool.list` across springs)
  - exp101: fieldMouse AI triage (sensor → NestGate → Squirrel → petalTongue)
  - exp102: Storytelling session loop (full pipeline on Desktop NUCLEUS)
  - exp103: ludoSpring expanded IPC (14 methods for esotericWebb)
  - exp104: RPGPT provenance replay (session DAG → ledger → replay)
  - exp105: **The Rhizome micro-game** — roguelike on NUCLEUS (Barracuda noise,
    game loop, petalTongue scenes, NestGate saves, provenance trio)
  - exp106: **Micro-desktop shell** — desktop composition (biomeOS routing,
    11/12 primal health bar, multi-session petalTongue, provenance sidebar)
- **4 desktop app deploy graphs**: `desktop_shell.toml`, `app_esotericwebb.toml`,
  `app_system_monitor.toml`, `app_rhizome.toml` — continuous coordination
- **3 new specs**: `RHIZOME_MICRO_GAME.md` (game design), `MICRO_DESKTOP_COMPOSITION.md`
  (desktop shell), `DESKTOP_NUCLEUS_DEPLOYMENT.md` + `DESKTOP_SESSION_MODEL.md` +
  `LIVE_GUI_COMPOSITION_PATTERN.md` (desktop patterns)
- `docs/LIVE_DEPLOYMENT_GAP_REPORT_PHASE56.md`: 23 gaps documented from live NUCLEUS
  deployment — socket naming, capability routing, IPC parameters, biomeOS parsers

### Fixed
- Provenance trio IPC schemas fully resolved (GAP-07 through GAP-11):
  rhizoCrypt `Custom` event needs `event_name` + `domain`, loamSpine payload inside
  variant, sweetGrass `braid.create` needs `mime_type` + `size`
- `desktop_nucleus.sh`: Auto-creates petalTongue discovery symlink (GAP-01 mitigation)
- Desktop graph TOMLs: dual `id`/`name` fields + lowercase `coordination` for
  biomeOS's three graph parsers (GAP-14 workaround)

### Updated
- Version bumped to 0.9.23
- Experiment count: 76 → 84 (18 tracks)
- Deploy graph count: 69 → 71 (4 desktop app graphs added)
- `wateringHole/` handoff docs refreshed for Phase 56 evolution
- `whitePaper/baseCamp/README.md` updated to v0.9.23 with Phase 56 status

## [0.9.22] — Phase 55c: Full Harvest — 12/12 Primals Resolved (2026-04-28)

### Absorbed
- **BearDog W75**: Deep debt — purpose-key module extraction (`aliases_and_beardog.rs`
  927→452 LOC), workspace dependency drift normalized, stale `dns-sd` feature gate removed,
  date-stamped test files renamed. Zero wire protocol changes. Still 101 CryptoHandler +
  9 IonicBondHandler methods.
- **barraCuda Sprint 47b**: Role-based naming (`register_with_songbird`→`register_with_discovery`,
  `songbird_capability_domains`→`discovery_capability_domains`), `naga-exec` silent fallbacks
  replaced with typed `NagaExecError::TypeMismatch` errors, autotune.rs observability added.
  12-axis deep debt audit clean. 272+ tests, 50 IPC methods.
- **sweetGrass v0.7.28**: Braid signing delegation to BearDog `crypto.sign` Ed25519 via
  `CryptoDelegate` module — `braid.create` carries Tower-level `Witness::from_tower_ed25519`
  witnesses. Anchor signing also delegated (`anchoring.anchor`). `hostname` crate eliminated
  for pure Rust. 1,462 tests. **Resolves Phase 55b P3 ask.**
- **loamSpine v0.9.16 (Apr 28)**: Tower-signed ledger entries — `entry.append` and
  `session.commit` sign via BearDog `crypto.sign_ed25519`, storing `tower_signature` in
  entry metadata. Chain hash commits to signed entry. Standalone mode continues unsigned.
  `prepare_entry()` + `append_prepared_entry()` split for signing between creation and
  chain append. BTSP tunnel consumption documented as next frontier. 1,509 tests.
  **Resolves Phase 55b P4 ask (signing delegation).**
- **ToadStool S205–S208**: Encrypted compute dispatch (`secrets.retrieve` purpose key +
  `crypto.encrypt`/`decrypt` on dispatch payloads via BearDog), `DISCOVERY_SOCKET`
  integration (highest-precedence tier for all capability resolution), self-registration
  via `register_with_discovery()` at startup (`ipc.register` with capabilities
  `["compute.dispatch","compute.capabilities"]`), deep debt (all `#[allow]` → `reason=`,
  workspace dep unification, stale feature removal, `expect` → `Result`, zero files >800L,
  all 49 unsafe blocks SAFETY-documented). 7,842 tests. **Resolves Phase 55b P5 ask.**

### Updated
- `docs/NUCLEUS_IPC_METHOD_MAP.md`: sweetGrass signing delegation, ToadStool encrypted
  dispatch + self-registration details
- Version bumped to 0.9.22
- **All 12 primals resolved** — zero remaining upstream asks from Phase 55/55b

### Desktop NUCLEUS Readiness
- **12/12 plasmidBin binaries present** (musl-static, symlinked at `primals/`)
- `desktop_nucleus.sh` and `composition_nucleus.sh` both operational
- Two launch paths: biomeOS coordinator and shell-managed composition
- All 12 primals: full env wiring, signing delegation, discovery self-registration
- Crypto stack complete: seed fingerprints → HKDF → family keys → purpose keys →
  per-primal encrypt/decrypt + Tower-signed operations across all three atomics

## [0.9.21] — Phase 55b: Upstream Harvest + Guidance (2026-04-28)

### Absorbed
- **NestGate v0.4.70 S48**: Native encrypt-at-rest (ChaCha20-Poly1305) with
  BearDog key delegation. `NESTGATE_AUTH_MODE=beardog` JWT bypass implemented.
  8,840 tests, zero debt markers. Directly resolves our Phase 55 crypto ask.
- **biomeOS v3.30**: Deep debt cleanup — `events.rs` smart refactor (831→385 LOC),
  `RpcExtractionError` thiserror migration, JWT secret hardened to per-family,
  `/tmp` centralized, `skip_signature_check` plumbing, `#[expect(reason)]` policy.
  7,814+ tests.
- **Songbird W178**: 20+ `Result<_, String>` → `anyhow::Result` across 6 crates,
  infallible functions simplified, hardcoded NodeId → env-driven. 7,692 tests.
- **Squirrel session AN**: HTTP provider support (`inference.register_provider`
  with `endpoint` for Ollama), `DISCOVERY_SOCKET` capability resolution
  (`discovery.find_provider` as Method 2), inference payload encryption
  foundation (`SecurityProviderClient` with purpose-key RPC surface).
  7,182 tests, 90.1% coverage.
- **Squirrel session AO**: Lying stub elimination — 6 functions now return honest
  errors instead of fabricating success. Fake marketplace data removed.

### Updated
- `docs/NUCLEUS_IPC_METHOD_MAP.md`: NestGate encrypt-at-rest docs, Squirrel
  HTTP providers + discovery resolution + crypto foundation
- Upstream gaps narrowed: NestGate encrypt-at-rest RESOLVED, Squirrel discovery
  RESOLVED. Remaining: BearDog purpose-key RPC server-side, rhizoCrypt/sweetGrass
  Tower crypto delegation, loamSpine BTSP active channels

### Upstream Guidance (all resolved as of Phase 55c)
- ~~BearDog: purpose-key RPC~~ **RESOLVED W74**
- ~~rhizoCrypt: signing delegation~~ **RESOLVED S54**
- ~~sweetGrass: signing delegation~~ **RESOLVED v0.7.28**
- ~~loamSpine: Tower-signed entries~~ **RESOLVED** (Apr 28) — `entry.append` + `session.commit` via `crypto.sign_ed25519`
- ~~ToadStool: self-registration + encrypted dispatch~~ **RESOLVED S205–S208**
- ~~barraCuda: self-registration~~ **RESOLVED Sprint 47**

## [0.9.20] — Phase 55: Two-Tier Crypto Architecture + Live Desktop Compositions (2026-04-28)

### Milestone
**Two-tier crypto architecture operational.** Published seed fingerprints (Tier 0: public DNA)
→ HKDF base keys → family keys with FAMILY_SEED (Tier 1: deployment isolation) → per-atomic
purpose keys. Composition-level encrypt-at-rest via BearDog delegation. NestGate JWT deprecated
within NUCLEUS compositions (NESTGATE_AUTH_MODE=beardog). Full Tower wiring for all 12 primals
including ToadStool (was missing BEARDOG_SOCKET/BTSP_PROVIDER_SOCKET). Live desktop compositions
with petalTongue GUI, branching state exploration via DAG+ledger+braid, and biomeOS cellular
deployment patterns validated.

### Added
- `tools/nucleus_crypto_bootstrap.sh` — derives and stores two-tier purpose keys via BearDog
- Crypto tier validation in `desktop_nucleus.sh validate` (seed fingerprints, HMAC derivation,
  BTSP session, sign/verify round-trip, secrets store/retrieve)
- Composition-level encrypted storage helpers in `nucleus_composition_lib.sh`
  (`tower_encrypt`, `tower_decrypt`, `encrypted_store`, `encrypted_retrieve`)
- `NESTGATE_AUTH_MODE=beardog` env var for NUCLEUS compositions (JWT bypass)
- `DISCOVERY_SOCKET` wired to all 12 primals for Songbird capability resolution
- `infra/wateringHole/NUCLEUS_TWO_TIER_CRYPTO_MODEL.md` — full crypto architecture docs

### Changed
- ToadStool startup: added BEARDOG_SOCKET, BTSP_PROVIDER_SOCKET, FAMILY_SEED, DISCOVERY_SOCKET
- barraCuda, coralReef, petalTongue: added DISCOVERY_SOCKET and FAMILY_SEED to startup
- NestGate JWT secret changed from random to sentinel value in NUCLEUS compositions
- All Nest primals (rhizoCrypt, loamSpine, sweetGrass): added DISCOVERY_SOCKET
- Cell graph `nucleus_desktop_cell.toml`: added NESTGATE_AUTH_MODE

### Upstream Gaps (ALL RESOLVED as of 0.9.22 Phase 55c)
- ~~NestGate: no native encrypt-at-rest~~ **RESOLVED v0.4.70 S48** (ChaCha20-Poly1305)
- ~~Squirrel: DISCOVERY_SOCKET not used for capability resolution~~ **RESOLVED session AN**
- ~~rhizoCrypt: local hashing, not delegating to Tower~~ **RESOLVED S54** — vertex
  signing via `crypto.sign_ed25519` shipped S52. Hash delegation correctly declined
  (BLAKE3 is deterministic/keyless, 1000x IPC penalty, signature already covers hash)
- ~~sweetGrass: local hashing, not delegating to Tower~~ **RESOLVED v0.7.28** — braid
  + anchor signing via `crypto.sign` Ed25519 shipped
- ~~BearDog: purpose-key RPC~~ **RESOLVED W74** — lazy purpose-key derivation +
  purpose encrypt/decrypt
- ~~barraCuda: DISCOVERY_SOCKET self-registration~~ **RESOLVED Sprint 47**
- ~~loamSpine: Tower signing~~ **RESOLVED** (Apr 28) — `entry.append` + `session.commit`
  via `crypto.sign_ed25519`. BTSP tunnels documented as next frontier
- ~~ToadStool: self-registration + encrypted dispatch~~ **RESOLVED S205-S208**

## [0.9.17+] — Phase 45c: BTSP Default Everywhere + Full NUCLEUS Convergence (2026-04)

### Milestone
**BTSP authentication default on all tiers — 13/13 converged.** guidestone reports
**187/187 ALL PASS**, **13/13 capabilities BTSP-authenticated** (was 5/13 pre-Phase 45c).
Layer 7 cellular deployment: 8 cell graphs with per-node `security_model = "btsp"`.
biomeOS v3.25 absorbed: graph bootstrap pre-registration + BTSP runtime escalation.
JSON-line BTSP auto-detection and full handshake relay wired into all 12 upstream primals.
Cleartext is a FAIL, not a pass. Full NUCLEUS BTSP convergence achieved April 24, 2026.

### Changed
- `PROACTIVE_CAPS` expanded to all 17 capabilities (security, discovery, compute,
  tensor, shader, storage, ai, dag, commit, provenance, visualization, ledger,
  attribution, inference, spine, merkle, braid)
- guidestone `tiers` updated: Node and Nest expect `"btsp"` (was `"tower_delegated"`)
- `tower_delegated` pass-through logic removed — cleartext always FAILs
- `BTSP_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT_SECS` (15s) for relay primals calling BearDog during handshake
- `Transport::unix_btsp()` uses handshake timeout then reverts to IPC timeout (5s)
- `nucleus_launcher.sh`: family-scoped symlinks for attribution/ledger/merkle/visualization/inference capabilities, `crypto-{family}.sock` symlink, `BIOMEOS_FAMILY_ID` for coralReef

### Upstream BTSP Fixes Driven by primalSpring
- **ToadStool**: JSON-line BTSP sub-detection in `0x7B` path, `relay_json_line_handshake`
- **barraCuda**: `is_btsp_client_hello` detects `"protocol":"btsp"`, `session_verify_rpc` passes `client_ephemeral_pub` + `preferred_cipher`
- **coralReef**: full `relay_json_line_handshake`, `b64_encode` helper (no `rand` dep), `BtspSessionError` made pub, `BIOMEOS_FAMILY_ID` wiring
- **NestGate**: `resolve_security_socket_path` env-var priority, JSON-line framing in `perform_handshake`, `session_token`/`response` field alignment
- **Squirrel**: `json_line_mode` in `btsp_handshake_after_client_hello`, `write_json_line`/`read_json_line_msg` helpers, BearDog challenge extraction

### Common fixes across all 5 relay primals
- `btsp.session.create`: send `family_seed` (base64-encoded) instead of `family_seed_ref`
- `btsp.session.verify`: `session_token` (not `session_id`), `response` (not `client_response`)
- Challenge sourced from BearDog's `btsp.session.create` response (not locally generated)
- `session_id` / `session_token` fallback parsing

### Final Convergence Fixes (April 24, 2026)
- **Songbird** (Wave 169): `SecurityRpcClient::new()` → `new_direct()` in `bin_interface/server.rs` (lines 436, 468) — discovery capability was routing BTSP through Neural API instead of direct BearDog
- **ToadStool**: Post-handshake connection kept alive for NDJSON RPC (was dropping after successful handshake)
- **loamSpine**: `btsp.negotiate` made non-fatal in `handshake.rs` — BearDog doesn't implement this method; loamSpine now defaults to client's preferred cipher
- **petalTongue**: BearDog field alignment, BTSP server fully converged
- **primalSpring**: `upgrade_btsp_clients()` second pass — BTSP-first connection for capabilities with discoverable sockets but no existing client (covers BTSP-enforcing primals that reject cleartext)

### Resolved
- All 13/13 capabilities BTSP-authenticated — zero upstream BTSP debt remaining
- All seed fingerprint mismatches resolved via plasmidBin reharvest

## [0.9.17] — Phase 45: genomeBin Cross-Architecture Depot + Deployment Validation (2026-04-20)

### Milestone
**46 binaries across 6 target triples (Tier 1 39/39).** plasmidBin evolved from flat
x86_64+aarch64 layout to full genomeBin `primals/{target-triple}/` directory structure
per ecoBin Architecture Standard v3.0. Full deployment validation: local 12/12,
benchScale Docker 12/12, remote fetch sim 13/13 checksums verified.

### Added
- `build_ecosystem_genomeBin.sh` — replaces `build_ecosystem_musl.sh`, full 9-target
  matrix with tiered build (Tier 1 MUST → Tier 2 SHOULD → Tier 3 NICE), per-target
  linker configuration, cargo check + full build pipeline
- armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf support: 10 primals built (RaspPi/ARM32)
- x86_64-pc-windows-gnu support: barraCuda built as .exe
- aarch64-linux-android support: 5 primals built for Pixel/GrapheneOS
- riscv64gc-unknown-linux-musl: primalSpring linked, all others cargo-check pass
- macOS (x86_64 + aarch64): 8/14 primals cargo-check pass (proves pure Rust)
- Backward-compat symlinks: `primals/{binary}` -> `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/{binary}`

### Changed
- `plasmidBin/manifest.toml` version 5.1.0 (genomeBin format), full target matrix
- `plasmidBin/checksums.toml` — BLAKE3 per target triple for all 46 binaries
- `plasmidBin/start_primal.sh` — auto-detects target triple from `uname`
- `plasmidBin/deploy_pixel.sh` — resolves from `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl/`
- `plasmidBin/fetch.sh` — target-triple-aware binary resolution
- `plasmidBin/harvest.sh` — supports arbitrary target triples
- `benchScale/deploy-ecoprimals.sh` — resolves from genomeBin layout, symlink-safe
- `wateringHole/genomeBin/manifest.toml` — v5.0.0 with full coverage matrix

### Phase 45 — Upstream Evolution Absorbed
- toadStool armv7 usize overflow fixed upstream (cfg target_pointer_width gating)
- biomeOS armv7/aarch64 rebuilt with correct workspace binary target (`biomeos-unibin`)
- nestgate cross-arch builds restored (armv7 target installed)
- coralReef iter84 absorbed: `--port` → `--rpc-bind` CLI change
- beardog HSM session 43: BTSP FAMILY_SEED env var requirement documented
- squirrel, songbird, petalTongue upstream evolutions pulled and validated

### Phase 45 — Deployment Validation
- `start_primal.sh`: auto-set BEARDOG_FAMILY_SEED from --family-id, coralreef --rpc-bind
- Local NUCLEUS: 12/12 primals alive (x86_64-unknown-linux-musl)
- benchScale Docker: 12/12 primals alive, songbird security provider configured
- Remote fetch simulation: 13/13 x86_64 binaries, checksums verified
- Pixel payload staged: 13 aarch64-unknown-linux-musl binaries validated

### Documented Gaps (Reduced)
- nestgate/skunkbat: lib-only on cross-targets (workspace binary structure — upstream fix needed)
- macOS: cargo check proves pure Rust, full link requires osxcross
- RISC-V: cargo check pass, full link requires complete musl sysroot

## [0.9.16+] — Phase 44: Deep Debt Evolution + Capability-Based Discovery (2026-04)

### Evolution
**Deep debt elimination.** All production code now references `primal_names::`
constants — zero hardcoded primal name strings in 11 core modules. TCP fallback
port table centralized via `tcp_fallback_table()` referencing `tolerances::`
constants. Test suites extracted from `harness/mod.rs` (874→623 LOC) and
`bonding/mod.rs` (860→464 LOC) to companion `tests.rs` files. Unified workspace
`serde_json` in exp094. `handle_bonding_status` evolved from placeholder to typed
response. Added `TCP_FALLBACK_PETALTONGUE_PORT` constant. **601 tests, zero clippy
warnings (pedantic+nursery), zero fmt drift.**

## [0.9.16] — Phase 44: guideStone Level 4 + Live NUCLEUS Validation + plasmidBin Depot (2026-04-20)

### Milestone
**guideStone Level 4 — NUCLEUS guideStone works.** 67/67 ALL PASS against live
12-primal NUCLEUS deployed from plasmidBin. 41/41 bare checks (Level 3).
BLAKE3 checksums (P3 self-verifying). plasmidBin documented as remote depot
for downstream live deployments. 72 clippy warnings eliminated (zero remaining).
9 new gaps discovered and 7 resolved during live validation (PG-16 through PG-23).

### Added
- **`primalspring::checksums` module**: BLAKE3 file hashing, manifest generation
  (`generate_manifest()`), and verification (`verify_manifest()`). Used by
  guideStone Property 3 (self-verifying). Depends on `blake3` crate.
- **`IpcError::is_protocol_error()`**: Classifies wire-level protocol violations
  (HTTP-on-UDS) as reachable-but-incompatible. Used by guideStone and
  `validate_liveness()` for graceful degradation.
- **Family-aware capability discovery**: `discover_by_capability()` now checks
  `{capability}-{family}.sock` before falling back to `{capability}.sock`.
- **`validation/CHECKSUMS`**: BLAKE3 manifest of 18 validation-critical files.
- **`examples/gen_checksums.rs`**: Generator for CHECKSUMS manifests.
- **`wateringHole/PLASMINBIN_DEPOT_PATTERN.md`**: Documents plasmidBin as
  remote binary depot for downstream spring teams.

### Changed
- **guideStone graph parsing**: Fragments validated as `[fragment]` TOML (not
  `[graph]`). Manifests/templates skipped. Profiles validated after resolution.
- **guideStone shader check**: Accepts coralReef's `supported_archs` response
  format (not just legacy `capabilities` array).
- **guideStone exit semantics**: Protocol errors treated as SKIP (reachable but
  mismatched) rather than FAIL, in both `validate_liveness()` and Layer 2.
- **`validate_liveness()` in `composition/mod.rs`**: Protocol errors increment
  alive count (primal is reachable, just different protocol dialect).
- **`meta_tier.toml`**: Added explicit order values (10/11/12) to prevent
  duplicate-order conflicts in profile resolution.
- **Profile order fixes**: `full.toml` (12→99), `nest_viz.toml` (4→7).
- **Validation graph TOML fixes**: `crypto_negative_validate.toml` and
  `nucleus_atomics_validate.toml` migrated from illegal duplicate
  `[graph.node.operation]` tables to per-entry `[graph.nodes.operation]`.
- **72 clippy doc_markdown warnings fixed** across 14 source files via auto-fix.

### Fixed
- **`start_primal.sh`** (plasmidBin): `serve` → `server` for provenance trio;
  removed unsupported `--bind` from squirrel case.

### Documentation
- `PRIMAL_GAPS.md`: primalSpring upgraded to Level 4; 9 new gaps (PG-16–PG-23).
- `GUIDESTONE_COMPOSITION_STANDARD.md` v1.1.0: BLAKE3 checksums integration
  pattern, updated readiness table.
- `NUCLEUS_SPRING_ALIGNMENT.md`: Updated for guideStone Level 4.

## [0.9.15] — Phase 43+: Graph Consolidation + Fragment-First Composition + guideStone (2026-04-16)

### Milestone
**78 → 56 deploy graph TOMLs.** Fragment-first composition eliminates isomorphic duplication.
All profiles resolve fragments at load time via `resolve = true`. Template+manifest pattern
replaces per-spring/per-downstream boilerplate. Stadial parity gate complete: zero `dyn`,
zero `async-trait`, Edition 2024, `#[expect]` over `#[allow]` everywhere.

### Changed
- **Fragment-first `load_graph()`**: Graphs declaring `resolve = true` in `[graph.metadata]`
  inherit nodes from `graphs/fragments/*.toml` as a base layer, then apply only their delta
  nodes. Implemented via `resolve_fragments()` in `ecoPrimal/src/deploy/mod.rs`.
- **9 profiles trimmed**: All `graphs/profiles/*.toml` reduced from ~40 to ~15 lines each,
  retaining only unique delta nodes and setting `resolve = true`.
- **Spring validation consolidated**: 13 → 4 files. `spring_validate_template.toml` +
  `spring_validate_manifest.toml` (9 parameterized compositions) + 2 unique validators.
- **Spring deploy consolidated**: 5 → 2 files. `spring_deploy_template.toml` +
  `spring_deploy_manifest.toml` (5 parameterized springs).
- **Downstream proto-nucleate consolidated**: 7 → 3 files. `proto_nucleate_template.toml` +
  `downstream_manifest.toml` (7 parameterized compositions) +
  `healthspring_enclave_proto_nucleate.toml` (unique dual-tower ionic bridge).
- **`nucleus_complete.toml`**: Now the canonical NUCLEUS deploy graph (absorbs former
  `primalspring_deploy.toml`).
- **`profiles/full.toml`**: Now the canonical full overlay (absorbs former `full_overlay.toml`).
- **`GraphMeta`**: Added optional `metadata` field with `fragments`, `resolve`, and
  fragment-resolution support structs.

### Removed
- **25 redundant graph files**: 9 spring validation wrappers, 5 per-spring deploy files,
  7 individual proto-nucleate files, `primalspring_deploy.toml`, `full_overlay.toml`,
  `fossilRecord/graphs/` stale snapshots.

### Documentation
- Updated README.md, CONTEXT.md, SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG.md with
  v0.9.15 metrics (570 tests, 75 experiments, 56 deploy graphs).
- Updated `graphs/README.md` with fragment resolution documentation and revised hierarchy.
- Updated `wateringHole/` docs with consolidated graph counts.
- New handoff: `wateringHole/GRAPH_CONSOLIDATION_AND_NUCLEUS_DEPLOYMENT_HANDOFF_APR16_2026.md`.
- `config/capability_registry.toml` and `deployment_matrix.toml` version/date updated.

### Added
- **`primalspring_guidestone` binary**: Self-validating deployable that certifies NUCLEUS
  composition correctness across 6 layers (bare properties, discovery, atomic health,
  capability parity, cross-atomic pipeline, bonding model, BTSP/crypto). Base certification
  layer that domain guideStones inherit from.
- **guideStone Composition Standard**: `wateringHole/GUIDESTONE_COMPOSITION_STANDARD.md` —
  ecosystem-wide standard for self-validating deployables (5 properties, 6 readiness levels,
  bare vs NUCLEUS modes, validation window concept).
- **Layered certification model**: primalSpring guideStone = base (composition), domain
  guideStone = domain (science). Domain guideStones can call `primalspring_guidestone` as
  a pre-flight check.
- **Composition API evolution**: `capability_to_primal()` made public, new
  `method_to_capability_domain()` and `validate_liveness()` for downstream springs.
- **guideStone readiness tracking** in `PRIMAL_GAPS.md`: primalSpring Level 1, hotSpring
  Level 5 (certified), 4 springs at Level 1, 2 at Level 0.

### Test Results
- **primalSpring**: 570 tests PASS, 0 failures, 0 clippy warnings.

## [Unreleased] — Phase 42–43: Multi-Tier Genetics + Cross-Architecture Deployment (2026-04-15)

### Milestone
**Multi-tier genetics identity system.** Mito-Beacon (discovery/NAT), Nuclear lineage
(non-fungible permissions with generational mixing), Tags (open participation from
plaintext seed heritage). BTSP Phase 3 types (ChaCha20-Poly1305 encrypted channels).
Cross-architecture Tower bootstrap on Pixel (aarch64 + GrapheneOS) via biomeOS Neural
API `--tcp-only`. **14/15 cross-arch checks pass** (HSM/Titan M2 pending upstream).
**NUCLEUS composition fully validated**: exp091 12/12 routing, exp094 19/19 parity.
All 7 biomeOS/NestGate composition gaps RESOLVED.

### Added
- **BTSP Phase 3 types**: `Phase3Cipher`, `NegotiateRequest`/`NegotiateResponse`,
  `SessionKeys` with HKDF-SHA256 key derivation and ChaCha20-Poly1305 in
  `ecoPrimal/src/btsp/phase3.rs`.
- **BtspEnforcer deny semantics**: Explicit deny per `TrustModel` (NuclearLineage,
  MitoBeaconFamily, TagOpen) in `bonding/mod.rs`.
- **Ionic bond protocol**: `IonicBondClient` RPC wrappers, `IonicPeerIdentity`,
  `DiscoveryMethod` in `bonding/ionic_rpc.rs`.
- **Content distribution federation**: `content_distribution_federation.toml` graph
  (8-phase pipeline, 4 bonding tiers, BLAKE3 content addressing). Domain types in
  `bonding/content_distribution.rs`.
- **`tcp_rpc_multi_protocol`**: Auto-fallback from raw TCP to HTTP POST in `ipc/tcp.rs`.
  Added `http_json_rpc` for Songbird HTTP transport.
- **exp096**: Cross-architecture bonding experiment — biomeOS Neural API health,
  proxied primal health, capability counts, FAMILY_ID verification, genetics RPC,
  BTSP Phase 3, HSM probing.
- **Genetics integration tests**: 4 new `#[ignore]` tests (mito-beacon, nuclear
  lineage, proof, entropy mixing) in `server_ecosystem.rs`.
- **Three-tier genetics validation** in exp073 LAN covalent mesh.
- **biomeOS bootstrap.rs patch**: Environment inheritance for `BIOMEOS_PLASMID_BIN_DIR`,
  `ECOPRIMALS_PLASMID_BIN`, `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, `FAMILY_SEED`.

### Fixed
- **`tcp_rpc` shutdown(Write)**: Removed premature half-close that prevented server
  responses. Added `flush()` instead.
- **`FAMILY_SEED` encoding**: `raw_family_seed_from_env()` now auto-detects hex vs
  base64 encoding.
- **`prepare_spore_payload.sh` ECO_ROOT**: Fixed path depth (was one `dirname` short).
- **`validate_remote_gate.sh` ports.env path**: Fixed relative path to plasmidBin.

### Documentation
- Updated CONTEXT.md, README.md, experiments/README.md, wateringHole/README.md,
  whitePaper/baseCamp/README.md with Phase 43 metrics (74 experiments, 17 tracks).
- New handoff: `wateringHole/PRIMALSPRING_V0914_PHASE43_HANDOFF_APR14_2026.md` —
  per-primal evolution paths, spring deployment patterns, biomeOS gaps.
- New blurb: `wateringHole/BIOMEOS_COMPOSITION_GAPS_APR14_2026.md` — 7 upstream
  gaps with fix paths and validation evidence (all RESOLVED as of April 15).
- New doc: `wateringHole/UPSTREAM_CROSSTALK_AND_DOWNSTREAM_ABSORPTION.md` —
  primal cross-talk protocol (first-byte peek, socket naming, family-ID propagation)
  and spring/garden absorption patterns (maturity ladder, fragment composition,
  bonding models, library patterns to absorb).
- Updated `wateringHole/PRIMALSPRING_ECOSYSTEM_LEVERAGE_GUIDE.md` v1.4.0 —
  refreshed composition status, fixed broken `infra/wateringHole/` references.
- Updated `docs/PRIMAL_GAPS.md` — biomeOS routing fix, NestGate BTSP bypass,
  graph executor error reporting all RESOLVED.
- Added `fossilRecord/README.md` — archive directory index.
- Updated specs/PAPER_REVIEW_QUEUE.md, specs/CROSS_SPRING_EVOLUTION.md with Phase 43.

## [0.9.14] — Phase 41: Pre-Downstream Gap Resolution (2026-04-13)

### Milestone
**Pre-downstream gap resolution complete.** All 7 blocking/confusing gaps resolved
before handing to springs for absorption. 13 FullNucleus capabilities (was 11).
443 tests (was 441). DeployGraph now parses both single-node and multi-node dialects.

### Fixed
- **Songbird capability alias mismatch**: `ledger`, `attribution`, `visualization` now
  registered in Phase 5 launcher seeding. `FullNucleus` capabilities expanded from 11 to 13.
  `capability_to_primal()` maps all self-reported names (`spine`, `merkle`, `braid`, `provenance`).
- **`validate_parity_vec` silent element drop**: Non-numeric array elements now detected
  and reported explicitly instead of being silently filtered by `filter_map(as_f64)`.
- **`validate_parity` doc examples**: Module-level and function-level examples updated
  from `tensor.matmul` to `stats.mean` with correct `"data"` param and `"result"` key.
- **loamSpine `health.check` auto-param**: `CompositionContext::health_check()` now sends
  `{"include_details": true}` automatically for loamSpine capabilities.

### Changed
- **DeployGraph multi-node unification**: `GraphNode.name` accepts `id` alias. `binary`,
  `order`, `health_method` default when absent. `primal`, `operation`, `constraints`,
  `output` fields captured for multi-node sub-tables. `structural_checks()` skips
  binary/health/order validation for multi-node graphs. 2 new tests confirm parsing.
- **`NICHE_STARTER_PATTERNS.md`**: `tensor.softmax` result key `"values"` → `"result"`.

### Documented
- **BtspEnforcer limitations**: Struct-level and method-level docs explain cipher-upgrade-only
  semantics (never denies connections). Downstream README includes bonding enforcement table.
- **rhizoCrypt `dag.event.append` event_type**: Full 27-variant enum reference with 4 worked
  JSON examples added to downstream README.
- **`graphs/multi_node/README.md`**: Schema differences documented, deployment instructions.

### Test Results
- **primalSpring**: 443 tests PASS, 0 failures (2 new deploy tests for multi-node graphs).
- **exp094**: 19/19 PASS (unchanged — validates against live stack).

## [Unreleased] — Phase 40: NUCLEUS Complete — 12/12 ALIVE, 19/19 PASS (2026-04-13)

### Milestone
**exp094 NUCLEUS Composition Parity: 19/19 PASS, 0 FAIL, 0 SKIP.**
**12/12 primals ALIVE.** All LD gaps RESOLVED. Full NUCLEUS composition validated
across all 3 atomics (Tower + Node + Nest) + cross-atomic pipeline. 11 capabilities
discovered. This is the first time every primal is alive and every check passes.

### Resolved (Upstream — second pull cycle)
- **LD-10 RESOLVED** — barraCuda Sprint 42 phase 5: `fix(LD-10): replay consumed BTSP guard line to JSON-RPC handler`. JSON-RPC now fully operational on UDS (`stats.mean`, `capabilities.list`, 32 methods).
- **LD-06 RESOLVED** — rhizoCrypt S37: UDS unconditional, TCP opt-in. `rhizocrypt_alive` PASS. Provenance trio at full UDS parity.
- **Songbird Wave 139**: Self-healing socket auto-discovery — periodic 30s re-scan eliminates need for Phase 5 launcher seeding (retained as belt-and-suspenders).
- **BearDog**: TCP transport now skip when `--port`/`--listen` not passed.
- **petalTongue Sprint 6**: `--socket` CLI flag added for NUCLEUS launcher alignment. Now ALIVE in stack.

### Changed
- **Full ecosystem rebuild**: All 12 primals pulled, rebuilt, harvested to plasmidBin. Every primal has new commits addressing debt/gaps.
- **exp094**: `tensor_dot_3elem` replaced with `tensor_stats_mean` (barraCuda `stats.mean` — actual JSON-RPC wire method). `rhizocrypt_alive` now PASS (was SKIP).
- **Unit tests**: `node_parity_tensor_matmul_identity` updated to use `stats.mean` (barraCuda `tensor.matmul` uses session-based IDs, not inline data).

### Test Results
- **primalSpring**: 455 tests PASS, 0 failures.
- **exp094**: 19/19 PASS, 0 FAIL, 0 SKIP. 11 capabilities discovered.
- **NUCLEUS stack**: 12/12 primals ALIVE (including rhizoCrypt UDS, petalTongue, barraCuda).

## [0.9.13] — Phase 39: NUCLEUS Composition PASS — 17/17 exp094 (2026-04-13)

### Milestone
**exp094 NUCLEUS Composition Parity: 17/17 PASS, 0 FAIL, 2 SKIP.**
All 4 critical LD gaps resolved. Full NUCLEUS cross-atomic pipeline operational.

### Added
- **`nucleus_launcher.sh` Phase 5**: Registry seeding — after all primals start, launcher calls `ipc.register` on Songbird for 9 primals with their capability sets. Resolves LD-08 (Songbird auto-discovery races startup).
- **`IpcError::is_transport_mismatch()`**: Detects tarpc-socket-receives-JSON-RPC pattern (EAGAIN timeout). `validate_parity` and `validate_parity_vec` now gracefully SKIP on transport mismatch.

### Resolved (Upstream)
- **LD-04 RESOLVED** — ToadStool S203d: BTSP auto-detect via first-byte inspection.
- **LD-05 RESOLVED** — barraCuda Sprint 42 phase 2: eliminated TCP sidecar in UDS mode.
- **LD-08 RESOLVED** — Songbird Wave 138: socket auto-discovery + Phase 5 launcher seeding.
- **LD-09 RESOLVED** — loamSpine: TCP transports opt-in. UDS unconditional.

### Changed
- **`nucleus_launcher.sh`**: Removed `--unix` from barraCuda start args. Added Phase 5 registry seeding.
- **exp094**: `resolve_*` checks accept `native_endpoint`/`virtual_endpoint`. Transport mismatch → graceful SKIP.
- **Integration tests**: Updated overlay graph tests to current consolidated graphs.

### Test Results
- **primalSpring**: 455 tests PASS, 0 failures.
- **exp094**: 17/17 PASS, 2 SKIP (tensor.dot tarpc transport, rhizoCrypt TCP-only).

## [0.9.12] — Phase 38: Upstream Revalidation + Composition Parity (2026-04-12)

### Added
- **LD-08**: New gap — Songbird `ipc.resolve` returns "Primal not found" because primals don't call `ipc.register` at startup. Wire accepts `capability` param (Wave 137b) but no directory entries.
- **LD-09**: New gap — loamSpine binds `0.0.0.0:8080` on startup, conflicts with other services. Needs socket-only mode.

### Changed
- **Upstream revalidation**: Pulled + rebuilt + tested all 5 core NUCLEUS primals (barraCuda Sprint 42, BearDog Wave 38, ToadStool S203c, Songbird Wave 137d, NestGate Session 43d). Fresh ecoBins copied to plasmidBin.
- **exp094 revalidation**: 13/16 PASS (was 7/16). Tower Atomic fully operational, Nest storage roundtrip works (LD-03 resolved upstream), cross-atomic pipeline (hash→store→retrieve) PASS end-to-end.
- **`PRIMAL_GAPS.md` Class 5**: Full revalidation section added with per-primal socket/health/IPC status table. LD-03 marked RESOLVED upstream. LD-04/LD-05 re-assessed with current evidence.
- **`nucleus_launcher.sh`**: Fixed stale `compute.sock` symlink (pointed to `toadstool-${FAMILY_ID}.jsonrpc.sock`, now `toadstool-${FAMILY_ID}.sock`). Updated ToadStool status check to include new socket name. Added BTSP/Ed25519/X25519 aliases for BearDog. Fixed Squirrel alias to use family-scoped socket.

### Test Results (all 5 primals)
- **BearDog**: 14,774+ tests, 0 failures. CLEAN.
- **Songbird**: Build CLEAN, tests PASS.
- **NestGate**: 11,856+ tests, 0 failures. CLEAN.
- **ToadStool**: 1,025 passed, 2 failures (env-dependent localhost fallback). Non-blocking.
- **barraCuda**: 3,835 passed, 14 failures (ESN model + tensor scalar race under parallel load). Non-blocking.

## [0.9.11] — Phase 37: Live NUCLEUS Deployment + Downstream Patterns (2026-04-12)

### Added
- **9 composition parity tests** (`composition/mod.rs`): Tower (crypto.hash, capability.resolve, health.liveness), Nest (storage round-trip, NestGate health), Node (tensor.batch.submit, tensor.matmul identity, shader.compile.capabilities), NUCLEUS (cross-atomic pipeline: hash → store → retrieve → verify). All degrade to SKIP when primals absent, PASS against live NUCLEUS.
- **`ECOSYSTEM_EVOLUTION_CYCLE.md`** (`wateringHole/`): Water-cycle model for ecosystem evolution — mountains (primals), springs (validation), delta (domain springs), evaporation (gap feedback). Documents current season, acceleration effect, per-layer guidance, modernization debt section.
- **Composition Elevation Sprint Priorities** in `PRIMAL_GAPS.md`: 6-item primalSpring sprint roadmap with upstream enablement targets.
- **Class 4: Pre-Modern Async Rust** in `PRIMAL_GAPS.md`: Full ecosystem async-trait/dyn audit across 12 primals.
- **`CompositionContext::health_check()`**: Normalizes diverse primal health response formats (`{"alive":true}`, `{"status":"alive"}`, `{"status":"ok"}`) into single boolean.
- **`CompositionContext::hash_bytes()`**: Handles base64 encoding/decoding for BearDog `crypto.hash`.
- **`CompositionContext::resolve_capability()`**: Maps capability→primal_id for Songbird `ipc.resolve`.

### Changed
- **`PRIMAL_GAPS.md`**: Wire contract blockers (tensor/shader/dispatch) all marked RESOLVED. Sprint table updated: Tower + Nest + Node all UNBLOCKED, upstream primals all DELIVERED.
- **`SPRING_AUDIT_PROMPT.md`**: v2.2 — added `ECOSYSTEM_EVOLUTION_CYCLE.md` to required reading, seasonal context.
- **`NUCLEUS_SPRING_ALIGNMENT.md`**: Phase 36 — "Current Season: Mountain → Spring Transition" section.
- **`wateringHole/README.md`**: Added "Ecosystem Evolution" section to document index.

### Fixed
- **5 test fixtures** referencing archived graphs: `tower_atomic_bootstrap.toml` → `profiles/tower.toml`, `node_atomic_compute.toml` → `profiles/node.toml`, `tower_ai.toml` → `profiles/tower_ai.toml`, `conditional_fallback.toml` → `patterns/conditional_fallback.toml`. 428 → 437 tests, 0 failures.
- **3 pre-existing clippy warnings resolved**: unnecessary boolean not in `coordination/mod.rs`, missing `#[must_use]` on `strip_unix_uri`, if-let→`map_or_else` in `transport.rs`. clippy now returns 0 warnings.
- **`nucleus_launcher.sh`**: Added barraCuda + coralReef to Phase 2 (Node Atomic). Added `tensor` and `shader` to capability domain alias map. Updated stop sequence and status table.

### Documented
- **`exp094_composition_parity`**: New canonical NUCLEUS parity experiment (Tower + Node + Nest + cross-atomic pipeline). Live-tested against running NUCLEUS: 8 capabilities discovered, 7 PASS, 5 FAIL (upstream wire gaps), 7 SKIP.
- **`graphs/downstream/README.md`**: Index of proto-nucleate graphs with upstream gap table from live deployment.
- **`graphs/downstream/NICHE_STARTER_PATTERNS.md`**: Copy-paste-ready starter patterns for hotSpring (QCD), neuralSpring (ML), healthSpring (enclaves), wetSpring (genomics).
- **`PRIMAL_GAPS.md` Class 5**: 7 live deployment gaps (LD-01 through LD-07) from exp094 — base64 transport, ipc.resolve params, single-shot UDS, port conflicts, socket naming, health format inconsistency.
- **`SPRING_COMPOSITION_PATTERNS.md` §14**: NUCLEUS composition experiment pattern added with live deployment findings and key findings for springs.

## [0.9.10] — Phase 35: Seasonal Tightening + Composition Validation Library (2026-04-12)

### Added
- **Composition validation library** (`ecoPrimal/src/composition/`): `CompositionContext`, `validate_parity`, `validate_parity_vec` — capability-keyed IPC client management and one-call math parity comparison.
- **Typed IPC extractors** (`ipc/client.rs`): `call_extract<T>`, `call_extract_f64`, `call_extract_vec_f64`.
- **Math parity tolerances** (`tolerances/mod.rs`): 7 named constants (`EXACT_PARITY_TOL`, `CPU_GPU_PARITY_TOL`, `WGSL_SHADER_TOL`, `DF64_PARITY_TOL`, `STOCHASTIC_SEED_TOL`, `NETWORK_LATENCY_TOL`, `COMPOSITION_OVERHEAD_TOL`).
- **Composition parity checks** (`validation/mod.rs`): `check_composition_parity`, `check_composition_parity_vec`.

### Changed
- **`lib.rs`**: Rewritten module documentation — core intermediary role ("start, validate, surface gaps, provide library"), modules categorized as Core vs Supporting.
- **`coordination/mod.rs`**: `AtomicType::Node` now includes barraCuda + coralReef; `FullNucleus` includes all 11 primals.
- **`harness/mod.rs`**: `RunningAtomic::composition_context()` added.
- **All `#[allow(dead_code)]`** in `btsp_handshake.rs` converted to `#[expect(dead_code, reason = "...")]`.

### Removed
- **`inference/` module** (534 LOC): Archived to `fossilRecord/inference_module_apr12_2026/`. Speculative, unused — belongs with Squirrel/neuralSpring.
- **35 stale graph TOMLs** (4,328 LOC): `science/`, `sketches/`, `gen4/` archived to `fossilRecord/stale_graphs_apr12_2026/`. Graph count 102 → 67.
- **`EmergentValidation` struct** (29 LOC): Unused outside own tests.
- **`GraphExecutionResult` struct** (35 LOC): Unused outside own tests.
- **`spawn_neural_api` deprecated alias**: Removed from `launcher/mod.rs`.

### Fixed
- `BASE64.encode(&client_pub_bytes)` → `BASE64.encode(client_pub_bytes)` (clippy: borrowed expression).
- All `map_or` with function calls → `map_or_else` (clippy: function call in map_or).
- `PRIMAL_GAPS.md` split into active (865 LOC) + `PRIMAL_GAPS_RESOLVED_HISTORY.md` (522 LOC) to stay under 1000 LOC standard.

## [0.9.9] — Phase 33: Full Spring Alignment + Proto-Nucleate Coverage (2026-04-10)

### Added
- **3 new proto-nucleate graphs**: `airspring_ecology_proto_nucleate.toml` (Tower + Node + Nest, ecology/agriculture), `groundspring_geoscience_proto_nucleate.toml` (Tower + Node + Nest, measurement science), `wetspring_lifescience_proto_nucleate.toml` (Tower + Node + Nest + Meta, life science/chemistry). All 7 science springs now have proto-nucleates.
- **`NUCLEUS_SPRING_ALIGNMENT.md`** (`wateringHole/`): Comprehensive spring × atomic alignment matrix, per-spring composition diagrams, cross-pollination network, neuralSpring AI provider role documented.

### Changed
- **`hotspring_qcd_proto_nucleate.toml`**: Added Squirrel/neuralSpring AI cross-pollination evolution note.
- Deploy graph count: 93 → 96 (8 downstream proto-nucleates).

## [0.9.8] — Phase 32: NUCLEUS Validation & Spring Evolution Handoff (2026-04-10)

### Changed
- **`nucleus_atomics_validate.toml`**: Fixed old graph references (`tower_atomic_bootstrap` → `profiles/tower`, etc.), corrected SUMMARY atomic definitions to Phase 31 model (Node = Tower + ToadStool + barraCuda + coralReef, Nest = Tower + NestGate + provenance trio), bumped to v0.2.0.
- **`deployment_matrix.toml`**: Bumped to v3.0.0. Added `[atomics]` documentation section. Fixed `nucleus_3node`, `wan_federation`, `federation_10node`, `organo_metal_salt` topology primal lists to include full NUCLEUS (barraCuda, coralReef, provenance trio). Added `atomic = ` metadata to all 21 topologies. Updated `security_tiers.nucleus.primals`.
- **`PRIMALSPRING_COMPOSITION_GUIDANCE.md`**: Bumped to v0.9.8. Fixed Node/Nest/NUCLEUS definitions. Updated overlay graph refs to `profiles/` paths. Added Layer 0 (Atomics) to composition diagram. Added §16 Meta-Tier Primals section.
- **`PRIMALSPRING_ECOSYSTEM_LEVERAGE_GUIDE.md`**: Bumped to v0.9.8. Fixed Composition Patterns table atomic definitions. Added NUCLEUS Atomic Alignment (Phase 31) reference table. Updated deploy graph count to 93.

### Added
- **Spring Evolution Feedback Guidance** in `PRIMALSPRING_ECOSYSTEM_LEVERAGE_GUIDE.md`: Per-spring evolution map, feedback protocol, primal evolution priority table, and step-by-step session guide for springs evolving primals through composition.

## [0.9.7] — Phase 31: Atomic Cleanup & Bonding Alignment (2026-04-09)

### Fixed
- **3 multi_node graphs** (`three_node_covalent_cross_network`, `idle_compute_federation`, `friend_remote_covalent`): Merged duplicate `[graph.bonding_policy]` tables into single valid TOML sections.
- **5 graphs claiming `node_atomic` without coralReef**: Added coralReef nodes to `gaming_mesh_chimera`, `gen4_storytelling_full`, `ludospring_proto_nucleate`, `nucleus_game_session`, `ludospring_science_validation`.
- **6 graphs using `provenance_trio` where `nest_atomic` fits**: Upgraded to `nest_atomic` where NestGate + full trio present (`hotspring_qcd_proto_nucleate`, `healthspring_enclave_proto_nucleate`, `rpgpt_session_provenance`, `supply_chain_provenance`, `nucleus_complete`, `interactive_product`).
- **7 graph descriptions overstating "NUCLEUS"**: Replaced with accurate atomic descriptions where full NUCLEUS primals were not present.

### Changed
- **~20 graphs with understated fragments**: Updated `fragments` metadata to properly reflect atomics present (added `nest_atomic`, `node_atomic`, `meta_tier` where primals exist).
- **9 nucleated deploys gained `[graph.bonding_policy]`**: All cross-atomic graphs now declare bonding type, trust model, and encryption tiers per atomic boundary.
- **3 multi_node graphs gained `atomic_layout`**: Documents which gate plays which atomic role.

## [0.9.6] — Phase 30: NUCLEUS Atomic Alignment (2026-04-09)

### Added
- **6 atomic-aligned fragments** (`graphs/fragments/`): `tower_atomic` (electron: BearDog + Songbird), `node_atomic` (proton: Tower + ToadStool + barraCuda + coralReef), `nest_atomic` (neutron: Tower + NestGate + provenance trio), `meta_tier` (biomeOS + Squirrel + petalTongue), `nucleus` (Tower + Node + Nest), `provenance_trio` (kept). Aligned to gen3 ECOSYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE §3 particle model.
- **9 NUCLEUS profiles** (`graphs/profiles/`): `tower`, `node`, `nest`, `nucleus`, `full`, `tower_ai`, `tower_viz`, `node_ai`, `nest_viz`. Each is a documented slice of NUCLEUS with `base = "nucleus_complete"` metadata.
- **Spring validation template + manifest** (`spring_validate_template.toml` + `spring_validate_manifest.toml`): Parameterized skeleton replaces 6 identical per-spring validation graphs.
- **Execution patterns directory** (`graphs/patterns/`): `parallel_capability_burst`, `conditional_fallback`, `streaming_pipeline`, `continuous_tick` — coordination mode demonstrations.

### Changed
- **Fragment names aligned to atomics**: `tower_base` → `tower_atomic`, `wgsl_shader_pipeline` → `node_atomic`, `nucleus_core` → `nucleus`. All 93 graphs updated.
- **Meta-tier primals documented**: biomeOS, Squirrel, petalTongue operate at any atomic level — not part of any single atomic.
- **Nest Atomic now includes provenance trio**: rhizoCrypt + loamSpine + sweetGrass are integral to the neutron (storage + lineage).
- **4 ludo/webb sketch validates updated**: Reflect pure composition model (no spawnable binaries).
- **hotspring_deploy merged into proto-nucleate**: `spring_deploy/hotspring_deploy.toml` absorbed by `downstream/hotspring_qcd_proto_nucleate.toml`.
- Deploy graph count: 100 → 93 (+ 6 fragment definitions, 17 directories).

### Removed
- **8 root-level subset graphs**: `tower_atomic_bootstrap`, `tower_ai`, `tower_full_capability`, `node_atomic_compute`, `node_ai`, `nest-deploy`, `nest_viz`, `full_overlay` — replaced by `graphs/profiles/`.
- **6 per-spring validate files**: `airspring_validate`, `groundspring_validate`, `wetspring_validate`, `hotspring_validate`, `neuralspring_validate`, `healthspring_validate` — replaced by template + manifest.
- **3 composition files + directory**: `narration_ai`, `proprioception_loop`, `persistence_standalone` — absorbed into corresponding `composition_*_validate` files.
- **3 old fragment definitions**: `tower_base.toml`, `wgsl_shader_pipeline.toml`, `nucleus_core.toml` — replaced by atomic-aligned versions.
- **hotspring_deploy.toml**: Merged into `hotspring_qcd_proto_nucleate.toml`.

## [0.9.5] — Phase 29: Graph Consolidation + Composition Evolution (2026-04-09)

### Added
- **4 canonical fragment definitions** (`graphs/fragments/`): `tower_base` (biomeOS + BearDog + Songbird), `provenance_trio` (rhizoCrypt + loamSpine + sweetGrass), `wgsl_shader_pipeline` (coralReef + toadStool + barraCuda), `nucleus_core` (Tower + toadStool + NestGate + Squirrel). Documents the "periodic table" of NUCLEUS composition.
- **`composition_model` + `fragments` metadata**: Every deploy graph annotated with `composition_model = "pure"|"nucleated"|"validation"` and `fragments = [...]` listing which canonical patterns it composes. Makes isomorphic families visible.
- **Composition Evolution section** in `PRIMAL_GAPS.md`: documents that ludoSpring and esotericWebb are pure NUCLEUS compositions — the graph IS the product, biomeOS IS the execution engine.

### Changed
- **ludoSpring/esotericWebb proto-nucleates rewritten** as pure compositions (`composition_model = "pure"`): no `spawn = true` binary nodes. Game science capabilities map to barraCuda + toadStool + Squirrel + petalTongue. CRPG product maps to Squirrel + petalTongue + NestGate + provenance trio.
- **8 graphs rewritten**: `interactive_product`, `gen4_storytelling_full`, `gen4_storytelling_minimal`, `gen4_spring_composition`, `rpgpt_session_provenance`, `nucleus_game_session`, `ludospring_science_validation`, `gaming_mesh_chimera` — all ludo/webb binary nodes replaced with constituent NUCLEUS primals.
- **Gen4 naming normalized**: `biomeos` / `biomeos_api` / `biomeos_substrate` → canonical `biomeos_neural_api` across all 10 gen4 graphs. `depends_on` edges updated.
- Deploy graph count: 107 → 100 (7 deleted, 4 fragment definitions added separately).

### Removed
- **5 redundant sketches**: `ludospring_game_deploy`, `esotericwebb_tower_deploy`, `game_science_standalone`, `session_standalone`, `esotericwebb_composed_deploy` — superseded by rewritten proto-nucleates.
- **2 duplicate compositions**: `render_standalone.toml` (identical to `proprioception_loop`), `tower_ai_viz.toml` (redundant subset of `tower_ai`).

## [0.9.4] — Phase 28: BTSP Cascade, Inference Abstraction, Proto-Nucleate Graphs (2026-04-10)

### Added
- **BTSP client handshake** (`ipc::btsp_handshake`): Client-side secure-by-default authentication module. All socket connections can now perform `btsp.handshake` before capability calls.
- **Inference wire standard** (`inference` module): Vendor-agnostic `inference.complete`, `inference.embed`, `inference.models` wire types and `InferenceClient` in ecoPrimal. Decouples AI inference from CUDA/Ollama vendor lock-in.
- **Squirrel inference bridge**: `inference.complete`/`embed`/`models` dispatch routes in Squirrel's JSON-RPC server, bridging ecoPrimal wire types to `AiRouter`.
- **5 proto-nucleate graphs** (`graphs/downstream/`): neuralSpring ML inference (WGSL shader composition), hotSpring Lattice QCD (metallic GPU pool, df64, provenance), healthSpring dual-tower enclave (ionic bond, egress fence, clinical AI). Two additional composition variants.
- **3 pipeline graphs**: neuralSpring inference pipeline, hotSpring QCD pipeline, healthSpring clinical pipeline — end-to-end data flow through primal compositions.
- **WGSL shader composition model**: ML inference, QCD physics, and biology are compositions of barraCuda's 826 WGSL shaders, compiled by coralReef, dispatched by toadStool. Springs are application layers, not compute engines.
- **Spring evolution nucleation** in `PRIMAL_GAPS.md`: hotSpring (proton-heavy, metallic bond, ionic lease for CERN cloud), healthSpring (neutron-heavy, dual-tower enclave, covalent mesh).

### Changed
- **BTSP Phase 2 cascade**: 11/13 primals enforce `btsp.handshake`. All 107 deploy graphs carry `[graph.metadata] secure_by_default = true` and `btsp_phase = 2`.
- **ToadStool semantic cleanup**: Removed unimplemented `ollama.*` and `inference.*` method mappings — ToadStool is compute substrate, not inference provider.
- Deploy graph count: 99 → 107 (5 downstream proto-nucleate + 3 pipeline).
- Root docs, CONTEXT.md, experiments/README synchronized to April 10 state.
- 404 tests, 72 experiments (15 tracks), 107 deploy graphs.

## [0.9.3] — Phase 26: Mixed Composition + Live Validation Matrix (2026-04-07)

### Added
- **Particle model specification** (`specs/MIXED_COMPOSITION_PATTERNS.md`): Tower = electron (trust boundary), Node = proton (compute, fungible), Nest = neutron (data at rest, non-fungible), NUCLEUS = atom. Grounded in Paper 23 (Mass-Energy-Information Equivalence).
- **Layered validation framework**: L0 (biomeOS + any primal), L1 (each atomic), L2 (mixed atomics), L3 (bonding patterns). Documented in `specs/NUCLEUS_VALIDATION_MATRIX.md`.
- **17 sketch graphs** (`graphs/sketches/`): L0 primal routing matrix (10 domains), L2 dual-tower ionic, dedicated tower, nest enclave, L3 covalent mesh backup, ionic capability lease, organo-metal-salt complex, plus variations.
- **exp091 primal routing matrix**: L0 validation — drives 10-domain Neural API routing sweep.
- **exp092 dual tower ionic**: L2 validation — two Tower Atomics with ionic bond structural validation.
- **exp093 covalent mesh backup**: L3 validation — sharded encrypted backup across covalent peer mesh.
- **Live validation matrix** (`specs/CROSS_SPRING_EVOLUTION.md`): Tower Atomic (BearDog + Songbird) fully validated live on Eastgate. 6 GAP-MATRIX items documented from systematic probing.

### Fixed
- **GAP-MATRIX-01 identified (Critical)**: Neural API detects primal sockets but reports 0 capabilities — blocks all `capability.call` routing. Direct IPC works.
- **GAP-MATRIX-02 identified (Medium)**: `tower_atomic_bootstrap.toml` fails biomeOS internal parser despite valid TOML.
- **GAP-MATRIX-03 identified (Low)**: Songbird TLS 1.3 cipher suite gaps for some HTTPS targets.
- **GAP-MATRIX-04 identified (Medium)**: NestGate HTTP REST IPC diverges from JSON-RPC over UDS model.

### Changed
- 404 tests, 72 experiments (15 tracks), 99 deploy graphs.
- Root docs, wateringHole, whitePaper/baseCamp, experiments/README, CONTEXT.md metrics synchronized.
- `CROSS_SPRING_EVOLUTION.md` updated with "Live Validation Matrix — April 7, 2026" section.
- `NUCLEUS_VALIDATION_MATRIX.md` updated with live validation results and sketch cross-references.

## [0.9.2] — Phase 25: Modernization Sweep (2026-04-07)

### Fixed
- **Capability naming**: `dag.dehydrate` → `dag.dehydration.trigger` across `capability_registry.toml`, `niche.rs`, and 17 graph files. Also fixed stale `dag.create_session`/`dag.append_event`/`dag.merkle_root`/`commit.session`/`commit.entry` → canonical dotted names in `primalspring_deploy`, `nucleus_complete`, `continuous_tick`, and `data_federation_cross_site` graphs.
- **Graph format unification (NA-016 resolved)**: Parser accepts `[[graph.node]]`, `[[graph.nodes]]`, and top-level `[[nodes]]` via serde alias + merge. All 87+ graphs migrated from `[[graph.node]]` to `[[graph.nodes]]`. Multi-node graphs converted from `[[nodes]]` to `[[graph.nodes]]` with `[graph.nodes.*]` subsections. `GraphMeta` gains optional `id` field.
- **HTTP health probe deprecated (NA-009 resolved)**: `http_health_probe` marked `#[deprecated]` — Songbird no longer exposes HTTP /health; Tower Atomic owns all HTTP. Experiments exp073, exp074, exp076, exp081 updated to use `tcp_rpc` with `health.liveness`.
- **Discovery tier count**: README corrected from 5-Tier to 6-Tier (plain socket name tier was missing from docs).

### Added
- **`nest-deploy.toml` v4.0**: Gold standard graph — HTTPS validation phase (order 5) calls `http.get` to `https://ifconfig.me/ip` through Tower Atomic. Songbird gains `mesh.init`, `mesh.auto_discover`, `mesh.peers` capabilities.
- **exp090 Tower Atomic LAN probe**: BirdSong mesh discovery, peer capability enumeration, HTTPS through Tower Atomic, STUN/NAT detection.
- **exp073 covalent bonding modernized**: Neural API routing validation, `FAMILY_ID` genetic lineage via BearDog `health.check`, end-to-end HTTPS through Tower Atomic.
- **`basement_hpc_covalent.toml`**: Canonical capability names, HTTPS validation phase between `gate_validate` and `announce_capabilities`.

### Changed
- 404 tests, 69 experiments (15 tracks), 92 deploy graphs.
- Root docs, wateringHole, whitePaper/baseCamp, experiments/README metrics synchronized.
- `CROSS_SPRING_EVOLUTION.md`: NA-009 and NA-016 marked RESOLVED with detailed notes.
- `SHOWCASE_MINING_REPORT.md`: "HTTP REST" references corrected to JSON-RPC 2.0 serialization.

## [0.9.1] — Phase 24b: rustChip B → A (2026-04-05)

### Fixed
- **rustChip**: B → A — 828 clippy warnings resolved to 0 (workspace cast allows for numeric code, auto-fix + manual source fixes). 237 tests added across 5 crates (was 0 test functions).

## [0.8.0x] — Phase 23x: Ecosystem Compliance Matrix — 9 Tiers, 14 Primals (2026-04-04)

### Added
- **`wateringHole/ECOSYSTEM_COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.md` v1.0.0** — Comprehensive compliance matrix covering 40+ auditable dimensions across 9 tiers (Build Quality, UniBin/ecoBin, IPC Protocol, Discovery/Self-Knowledge, Semantic Naming, Responsibility/Overstep, Workspace Dependencies, Presentation, Deployment/Mobile). Each primal graded A–F per tier with rollup grade. Supersedes `IPC_COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.md` v1.6.0.

### Audited
- **Phase 2 checks** across all 14 primals: `forbid(unsafe_code)`, `warn(missing_docs)`, CONTEXT.md, `#[allow(` vs `#[expect(`, PII scan, workspace dependencies, commented-out code, SPDX headers, C deps via `cargo tree`.
- **Grade distribution**: 1 A (rhizoCrypt), 7 B (BearDog, coralReef, biomeOS, petalTongue, sweetGrass, LoamSpine, sourDough), 3 C (Songbird, NestGate, Squirrel), 2 D (ToadStool, barraCuda), 1 F (bingoCube).
- **Top ecosystem gaps**: discovery debt (5 primals with >100 primal-name refs), license alignment (8 primals need `-or-later`), `#[allow(` migration (4 primals with >30 allow attrs), domain symlinks (8 primals missing).

### Changed

### Added
- **`wateringHole/PRIMAL_SELF_KNOWLEDGE_STANDARD.md` v1.0.0** — New canonical standard defining the self-knowledge boundary, capability domain registry, socket naming (`{domain}.sock` primary, `{primal}.sock` legacy symlink), env var conventions (`{DOMAIN}_SOCKET` not `{PRIMAL}_SOCKET`), six code organization patterns (provider traits, tiered discovery, serde aliases, deprecated test fixtures, capability.call, EnvSource injection), compliance audit checklist with scoring (A–F), and phased migration path. Unifies fragmented guidance from 7+ existing standards.

### Audited
- **Songbird wave 110-111**: Discovery **935→302 refs** (68% further reduction, 88% total since first audit). concurrent_helpers smart-refactored (787L → 8 modules). +38 tests. 12,568 tests passing. Clippy/fmt/deny CLEAN.
- **barraCuda**: Pushed clippy lint fix (stale `expect(clippy::large_stack_arrays)`). SIGSEGV is concurrent-test driver contention (llvmpipe/NVK) — passes single-threaded. Larger project for barraCuda team.

### Changed
- `docs/PRIMAL_GAPS.md` — Songbird status **X→P**, updated compliance matrix, discovery table, header
- `wateringHole/IPC_COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.md` — Songbird discovery X→P with measured data
- `wateringHole/PRIMAL_RESPONSIBILITY_MATRIX.md` — Songbird compliance updated, overstep detail expanded

## [0.8.0o] — Phase 23o: Responsibility Matrix Restructure + sourDough Integration (2026-04-03)

### Added
- **sourDough** added to `docs/PRIMAL_GAPS.md` gap registry — SD-01/02/03 (deny.toml, musl, signing), all Low. Compliance: clippy CLEAN, fmt PASS, 239 tests, discovery NEAR-CLEAN.
- sourDough added to guideline compliance matrix and discovery compliance table.

### Changed
- **`wateringHole/PRIMAL_RESPONSIBILITY_MATRIX.md` v2.3 → v3.0** — major restructure:
  - Added **Primal Directory**: clear role definitions, capability namespaces, and purpose for each primal.
  - Added sourDough (Tooling tier) and skunkBat (Nascent tier).
  - Added **Interaction Rules** section: discovery protocol, communication protocol, prohibition list.
  - Added **Capability Routing Guide**: quick-reference routing table for deploy graph design.
  - Added **Compliance Status** table with measured audit data from primalSpring full scan.
  - Simplified Overstep Detail section. Added Squirrel overstep (sled/crypto).
  - Reorganized Concern Matrix with sourDough column and `(resolved)` markers.
  - Designed for human and AI agent comprehension — defines primal roles to understand gaps and prevent overstep.
- **`wateringHole/IPC_COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.md` v1.5.0 → v1.6.0** — sourDough added to scorecard and discovery compliance; cross-reference to responsibility matrix v3.0.

## [0.8.0n] — Phase 23n: Full Audit Cycle Against WateringHole Standards (2026-04-03)

### Audited
- Full primal pull: nestGate (a75e9f2a) and toadStool (S172-5) had new evolution
- wateringHole pull: 2 new handoffs (nestGate v4.7.0, barraCuda v0.3.11), toadStool discovery X→C claim
- **nestGate**: Clippy CLEAN (was ~2 warnings), fmt PASS, 1449+ tests PASS. Discovery near-compliant: 7 files, zero primal env vars.
- **toadStool**: Clippy 2 warnings, fmt PASS, 21.5K tests PASS. Discovery improved but ~30 files + SONGBIRD_*/BEARDOG_SOCKET in fallbacks. Compliance claim overstated.
- **petalTongue**: Tests ALL PASS (was 1 failure — fixed). 24 env refs across 10 files.
- **Songbird**: fmt STILL FAILS. Discovery debt massive: 2558 refs in 321 files, 143 env-var refs in 50 files.
- **Squirrel**: clippy/tests STILL FAIL (ai-tools build error). 322 refs in 96 files.

### Changed
- `docs/PRIMAL_GAPS.md` — full audit findings, updated compliance matrix, discovery compliance table with measured ref counts
- `wateringHole/IPC_COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.md` v1.4.0 → **v1.5.0** — §Discovery Compliance updated with primalSpring scan data, corrected toadStool/Songbird statuses

## [0.8.0m] — Phase 23m: Downstream Graph Sketch Reframe (2026-04-03)

### Changed
- **Architectural correction**: ludoSpring is a parallel peer, esotericWebb is downstream. primalSpring does NOT own, build, or run their binaries.
- Moved ludoSpring/esotericWebb deploy graphs to `graphs/sketches/` — proto sketches co-evolved by primalSpring + ludoSpring, with esotericWebb as eventual owner.
- Moved ludoSpring/esotericWebb composition graphs to `graphs/sketches/`.
- Moved ludoSpring/esotericWebb validation graphs to `graphs/sketches/validation/` — sketches of how those systems should validate themselves.
- All moved graph headers updated with "PROTO SKETCH" designation and correct ownership.

### Reframed
- `validate_compositions.py` C3/C4/C7 no longer require downstream binaries:
  - **C3 → Session Readiness**: validates substrate + Tower + capability routing for narrative domain.
  - **C4 → Game Science Readiness**: validates substrate + Tower + capability routing for game domain.
  - **C7 → Product Readiness**: validates full primal stack health across all owned domains.
- `composition_game_science_validate.toml` → validates primal-layer readiness, not ludoSpring surface.
- `composition_session_validate.toml` → validates primal-layer readiness, not esotericWebb surface.
- `composition_interactive_validate.toml` → validates all owned primal domains, no downstream nodes.

## [0.8.0l] — Phase 23l: Evolution Pull + Discovery Compliance Re-Audit (2026-04-03)

### Audited
- Full primal pull and evolution review across all 12 primals
- **biomeOS v2.87**: Discovery compliance **RESOLVED** — identity-based routing removed from non-test code. All checks green.

- **Songbird wave 99**: Clippy clean (0 warnings), `discover_beardog→discover_security_provider` rename. **fmt regressed** (widespread). ~30 files still have legacy refs.
- **Squirrel alpha.31**: Capability-based discovery commit. **clippy/tests regressed** (ai-tools cfg gate). 7 files still have Songbird coupling.
- **barraCuda Sprint 27**: Clippy+fmt clean. **`fault_injection` test SIGSEGV** — new regression.
- BearDog, NestGate, toadStool, rhizoCrypt, loamSpine, sweetGrass: no new commits.

### Changed

### Changed
- `wateringHole/CAPABILITY_BASED_DISCOVERY_STANDARD.md` v1.1.0 → **v1.2.0**: Added compliance audit checklist with grep patterns, per-primal findings, SHOULD → MUST upgrade
- `wateringHole/IPC_COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.md` v1.3.2 → **v1.4.0**: Added §Capability-Based Discovery Compliance with per-primal matrix and priority ranking
- `docs/PRIMAL_GAPS.md`: Added §Capability-Based Discovery Compliance matrix linking to IPC Compliance Matrix

## [0.8.0j] — Phase 23j: Evolution Pull + Deep Debt Synthesis (2026-04-02)

- coralReef + barraCuda deferred (separate scope)

## [0.8.0i] — Phase 23i: Re-Audit Cycle + Overstep Verification (2026-04-02)

### Changed
- `docs/PRIMAL_GAPS.md` — re-audit with overstep scan and compliance recheck:
  - NG-01 reclassified Medium → **Low** (StorageBackend trait injection wired; metadata axis residual)
  - SB-02 reclassified to **Near-resolved** (rcgen removed from lockfile; ring not compiled in default)
  - SB-03 reclassified to **Improved** (sled feature-gated in all 3 crates)
  - All 8 open gaps now **Low** severity — zero critical, zero high, zero medium
  - Added overstep audit section confirming PRIMAL_RESPONSIBILITY_MATRIX alignment

### Compliance Evolution
- **Songbird**: 395 → **8** clippy warnings (wave93 ring elimination, concurrency fix)
- **NestGate**: **regressed** — 16 warnings + test compile errors; BUT `deny.toml` now present
- **loamSpine**: fmt now **PASSES** (was failing)
- **petalTongue**: tests now **PASS** (was 1 failure)
- **toadStool**: tests now **PASS** (was 1 failure), fmt **still fails**

### Overstep Scan
- No new boundary violations found
- Confirmed: rhizoCrypt/loamSpine TCP = standard IPC dual-mode (not networking overstep)
- biomeOS `redb`, BearDog `axum`+AI, Songbird `sled` = known items per matrix
- toadStool S169 cleanup holds (30+ methods removed)

## [0.8.0h] — Phase 23h: Full Primal Audit + Guideline Compliance (2026-04-01)

### Changed
- `docs/PRIMAL_GAPS.md` — full primal audit with guideline compliance matrix:
  - SQ-03 reclassified as **RESOLVED** (documented in `CURRENT_STATUS.md`, intentional retention)
  - NG-01/NG-02/NG-03 reclassified as **Improved** (unix-socket path is durable; session save/load exists; data/storage separation documented)
  - Added per-primal compliance data: clippy, fmt, unsafe policy, deny.toml, SPDX, test status
  - 19 gaps resolved (was 18), 8 open (1 medium, 7 low)

### Audit Findings
- **BearDog**: gold standard compliance — workspace `forbid(unsafe_code)`, clippy clean, 14K+ tests
- **NestGate**: missing `deny.toml`, 3 test failures (timing/env), tarpc path still in-memory
- **toadStool**: `cargo fmt` failure, 1 test failure, no workspace `forbid(unsafe_code)`
- **loamSpine**: `cargo fmt` failure (needs `cargo fmt --all`)
- **Songbird**: 395 clippy warnings in orchestrator tests (`unwrap_used`), `sled` still direct dep
- **petalTongue**: 1 test failure (`provenance_trio` discovery test), callback push not wired
- **Squirrel**: no workspace `forbid(unsafe_code)` (uses clippy groups)

## [0.8.0g] — Phase 23g: Primal Rewiring + Gap Cleanup (2026-04-01)

### Changed
- `ecoPrimal/src/ipc/methods.rs` — aligned with primal evolution:
  - `graph::DEPLOY` → `graph::EXECUTE` (matches actual biomeOS routing target)
  - Added `topology::RESCAN` (biomeOS v2.81)
  - Added `ember::LIST`, `ember::STATUS` (toadStool S171 hardware lifecycle)
  - Added `ai::QUERY`, `ai::LIST_PROVIDERS` (Squirrel)
  - Added `visualization::*`, `interaction::*` (petalTongue)
  - Removed `shader::COMPILE_WGSL` (coralReef domain since S169)
  - Removed downstream modules (`game::*`, `webb::*`, `session::*` — springs/gardens own these)
- `ecoPrimal/src/ipc/neural_bridge.rs` — added `topology_rescan()` for biomeOS v2.81
- `ecoPrimal/src/ipc/discover.rs` — added plain socket name discovery (`{name}.sock`, `{name}-ipc.sock`) for primals that don't use family-suffixed sockets
- `tools/validate_compositions.py` — updated SQ-02 messaging (resolved), NestGate `storage.list` passes `family_id`, C7 Squirrel check now live (not hardcoded fail)
- `docs/PRIMAL_GAPS.md` — scoped to primals only (downstream removed), 18 resolved, 8 open

### Live Validation Results (2026-04-01)
- **43/44 (98%)** — up from 93% (previous) and 79% (pre-evolution)
- C5: Persistence now **5/5 PASS** (was partial)
- C7: Full Interactive now **10/10 PASS** (was 9/10)
- Only failure: C2 `ai.query` — environment dependency (no local Ollama), code is wired (SQ-02 resolved)

### Newly Resolved Gaps (this session)
- **SQ-02** — `LOCAL_AI_ENDPOINT` wired into AiRouter (alpha.27)
- **PT-05** — `RenderingAwareness` auto-init in `UnixSocketServer`
- **PT-07** — periodic discovery refresh in server mode
- **NG-04** — ring/aws-lc-rs eliminated (TLS → system curl)
- **NG-05** — nestgate-security zero crypto deps (BearDog IPC delegation)

## [0.8.0f] — Phase 23f: Composition Decomposition — 7 Subsystem Compositions (2026-03-28)

- `infra/wateringHole/handoffs/` — composition decomposition handoff, primal team gaps handoff, spring teams deployment handoff

### Changed
- `tools/ws_gateway.py` — refactored from monolithic orchestrator to thin WebSocket-to-IPC bridge: generic RPC pass-through, batch calls, capability discovery via biomeOS, zero business logic
- `web/play.html` — reclassified from game UI to composition monitor: shows subsystem health grid, C1-C7 cards with click-to-test, debug session section, all calls via thin bridge protocol
- Deploy graphs: 69 → 89 (21 validation, 7 compositions, 6 spring deploy)

### Live Composition Validation Results (2026-03-28)

## [Unreleased] — Phase 21: Deep Ecosystem Audit + Library Consolidation (2026-03-29)

### Added
- **`ipc::tcp` module** — shared TCP RPC helper (`tcp_rpc`, `tcp_rpc_with_timeout`,
  `http_health_probe`, `env_port`) extracted from 8 experiments into library; eliminates
  per-experiment TCP boilerplate
- **`ipc::methods` module** — centralized JSON-RPC method name constants (`health::LIVENESS`,
  `capabilities::LIST`, `provenance::SESSION_CREATE`, `coordination::VALIDATE_COMPOSITION`,
  etc.) — zero hardcoded method strings in experiments
- **`ipc::capability` module** — capability discovery and routing logic extracted from
  `ipc/discover.rs` with full test coverage
- **`tolerances::TCP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECS`**, `TCP_READ_TIMEOUT_SECS`,
  `TCP_WRITE_TIMEOUT_SECS` — centralized network timeout constants
- **Provenance circuit breaker half-open** — time-based half-open state with

- Phase 21 handoff: `PRIMALSPRING_V070_PHASE21_DEEP_AUDIT_HANDOFF_MAR29_2026.md`

### Changed
- **`launcher/` smart refactor** — split into 4 sub-modules: `discovery.rs` (binary resolution),
  `profiles.rs` (launch profile parsing), `spawn.rs` (process spawning + socket wait),
  `biomeos.rs` (biomeOS-specific logic). Public API preserved via re-exports
- **8 experiments consolidated** — `exp063`, `exp073`, `exp074`, `exp076`, `exp081`–`exp084`
  refactored from local TCP RPC to `ipc::tcp` library helpers
- **Hardcoded primal names eliminated** — 4 experiments (`exp065`, `exp075`, `exp076`,
  `exp083`) now use `primal_names::*` slug constants
- **Hardcoded method strings eliminated** — all experiments use `ipc::methods::*` constants
- **Library tracing** — `println!`/`eprintln!` → `tracing::info!`/`tracing::error!` in
  harness/mod.rs and validation/or_exit.rs
- **`PrimalClient` transport unification** — uses `Transport` enum internally (Unix + TCP)
- **`validate_release.sh` test floor** — 378 → 411
- All docs updated: 411 tests, Phase 21 status, new module documentation
- All clippy warnings resolved (pedantic + nursery + cast + unwrap/expect discipline)

## [Unreleased] — Phase 19: Gen4 Spring Scaffolding (2026-03-28)

### Added
- **gen4_spring_composition.toml** — master deploy graph: Tower + biomeOS + 5 spring primals
  + cross-spring validation node (36 graphs total, up from 35)

  healthspring, hotspring, ludospring, neuralspring, wetspring
- Phase 19 handoff: `SPRING_GEN4_SCAFFOLDING_PHASE19_HANDOFF_MAR28_2026.md`

### Changed
- All 7 spring validation graphs updated: biomeOS substrate node (`start_biomeos`, order 2)
  inserted before spring primal germination

### Built (upstream patches for spring compilation)
- **barraCuda** v0.3.5→v0.3.7: F16 precision variant, GPU feature-gating (`plasma_dispersion`,
  `analyze_weight_matrix`), 4 missing `DeviceCapabilities` methods, `rel_tolerance` on `Check`,
  `PrecisionRoutingAdvice` re-export
- **bingoCube/nautilus**: no-op `json` feature gate, `input_dim` on `ShellConfig`

  chaining: `ValidationResult::new(title).with_provenance(src, date).run(sub, |v| { ... })`
- **All 53 experiments carry structured provenance** — `with_provenance()` on every
  experiment (was 4/53). Source and baseline date traceable for every validation run

### Changed
- **`validation/mod.rs` refactored** — extracted 493-line test module to
  `validation/tests.rs`, production code now 540 lines (was 1016, over 1000 LOC limit)

  validation/coordination nodes (spawn=false). Defaults to true for backward
  compatibility with existing graphs

  primals beyond the base tier
- `RunningAtomic::all_capabilities()` — returns base + overlay capability names
- `RunningAtomic::overlay_primals()` — names of primals from the graph overlay
- 5 new overlay deploy graphs: `tower_ai.toml`, `tower_ai_viz.toml`,
  `nest_viz.toml`, `node_ai.toml`, `full_overlay.toml`

- Health liveness fallback chain: `health.liveness` → `health.check` → `health` → `{primal}.health`

### Fixed
- **NestGate ZFS hard-fail** — nestgate now degrades to filesystem mode when ZFS kernel module
  is not loaded (was: crash on startup). Fixed in `StorageState::new()` fallback to dev config
- **NestGate `socket_only` pattern match** — fixed pre-existing compile error in `cli.rs`
  where `Commands::Daemon` destructure was missing `socket_only` field
- **ToadStool socket discovery** — toadstool ignores `--socket` CLI flag, uses `TOADSTOOL_SOCKET`
  env var. Harness now passes socket via env and waits for `.jsonrpc.sock` suffix file

- 12 new capabilities in registry + federation translations in biomeOS

### Fixed
- **Songbird port contention** — added `--port 0` (ephemeral OS-assigned) support in songbird
  config validation and `bind_with_fallback`. All 19 integration tests now run in parallel (~1s)
  instead of requiring sequential execution (~30s)
- **BirdSong beacon API** — fixed `node_id` parameter requirement and `encrypted_beacon`
  field name for decrypt round-trip

  AI `ai.query` calls, API key passthrough from `testing-secrets/api-keys.toml`, and
  post-query Tower health validation
- 7 new integration tests: `tower_zombie_check` (Gate 1.5), `tower_discovery_peer_list`
  (Gate 3.5), `tower_tls_handshake` (Gate 4.1), `tower_tls_internet_reach` (Gate 4.2),
  `tower_tls_routing_audit` (Gate 4.3), `tower_squirrel_ai_query`, `tower_squirrel_composition_health`
- `PrimalProcess::from_parts()` — construct from pre-spawned components (custom spawn logic)

  `neural_registration.rs`; removed hardcoded `/tmp/beardog-default.sock` fallback
- **biomeOS** — enrollment uses `NeuralApiCapabilityCaller` (fallback to

  `discover_songbird_socket()` replaced with capability-based discovery
- **songbird** — new `songbird-crypto-provider` shared crate extracted from
  `songbird-http-client`; `tor-protocol`, `orchestrator`, `nfc`, `sovereign-onion`,
  and `quic` crates now route all crypto through Neural API; removed 7/8-tier
  identity-based socket discovery in favor of Neural API socket discovery
- Rebuilt and harvested updated beardog, songbird, and neural-api-server binaries
  to `plasmidBin/primals/`

### Fixed
- Unresolved doc link to `ValidationResult`
- `cargo fmt` formatting drift in 4 files
- Version drift (Cargo.toml 0.2.0 → 0.4.0 across all workspace members)
- `.gitignore` now excludes `audit.log` and `sqlite:/` test artifacts

- `print_status` — shows capability discovery status with provider names
- exp001–004 — evolved from identity-based to capability-based discovery
- exp006 — evolved from primal subset checks to `topological_waves()` from real graphs
- exp051 — evolved from `discover_for()` to `discover_capabilities_for()`
- `deploy::validate_live()` — `.expect()` replaced with proper `Result` propagation
- `coordination/mod.rs` — circuit breaker and retry parameters extracted to named constants
- `protocol.rs` — `"2.0"` literals replaced with `JSONRPC_VERSION`
- `niche.rs` — biomeOS registration target configurable via `BIOMEOS_PRIMAL` env var
- Formatting — `cargo fmt --all` applied (import ordering, line wrapping)

### Fixed
- TOCTOU panic in `validate_live()` when graph file mutates between parse calls

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-18

### Added
- IPC resilience stack absorbed from 7 sibling springs
- `IpcError` (8 typed variants with query helpers)
- `CircuitBreaker` and `RetryPolicy` with `resilient_call()`
- `DispatchOutcome<T>` — three-way dispatch outcome model
- `extract_rpc_result<T>()` and `extract_rpc_dispatch<T>()`
- 4-format capability parsing (Formats A/B/C/D)
- `health.liveness` and `health.readiness` Kubernetes-style probes
- `safe_cast` module (absorbed from airSpring/healthSpring/groundSpring)
- `OrExit<T>` trait for zero-panic validation binaries
- `ValidationSink` trait with `StdoutSink` and `NullSink`
- `PRIMAL_NAME` and `PRIMAL_DOMAIN` constants
- FAMILY_ID-aware discovery
- Neural API health checks via `neural-api-client-sync`
- Proptest for IPC protocol fuzzing (5 property tests)
- 132 unit tests (up from 69), zero warnings
- All 38 experiments evolved with real probe patterns

### Changed
- Version 0.1.0 → 0.2.0

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-17

### Added
- Neural API integration via `neural-api-client-sync` path dep
- `KNOWN_PRIMALS` removed — sovereignty fix
- Discovery evolved: composition-driven + Neural API
- Server mode: JSON-RPC 2.0 over Unix socket
- `probe_primal()`, `validate_composition()`, `health_check()`
- `check_or_skip()`, JSON output mode, `exit_code()`
- Workspace lints centralized
- 69 unit tests
- exp001 + exp004 IPC-wired with graceful degradation
- Zero warnings: check, clippy (pedantic+nursery), doc, fmt

## [0.0.1] — 2026-03-02

### Added
- Initial scaffolding — 38 experiments across 7 tracks
- Workspace compiles
- Coordination domain definition
